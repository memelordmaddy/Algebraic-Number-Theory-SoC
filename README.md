# Algebraic-Number-Theory-SoC
This is my repo for the Algebraic Number Theory SoC, a two month long programming project organized by the Web and Coding Club of IIT Bombay. I worked on this project under the mentorship of Nilabha Saha (@Nilabha13), and used 'A Computational Introduction to Number Theory and Algebra' by Victor Shoup as my primary reference.
